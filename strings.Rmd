## String Basics


### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
In code that doesn’t use **stringr**, you’ll often see `paste()` and `paste0()`. What’s the difference between the two functions? What **stringr** function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The function `paste` separates strings by spaces by default, while `paste0` does not separate strings with spaces by default.

```{r}
paste("foo", "bar")
paste0("foo", "bar")
```

Since `str_c` does not separate strings with spaces by default it is closer in behavior to `paste0`.

```{r}
str_c("foo", "bar")
```

However, `str_c` and the paste function handle NA differently.
The function `str_c` propagates `NA`, if any argument is a missing value, it returns a missing value.
This is in line with how the numeric R functions, e.g. `sum`, `mean`, handle missing values.
However, the paste functions, convert `NA` to the string `"NA"` and then treat it as any other character vector.
```{r}
str_c("foo", NA)
paste("foo", NA)
paste0("foo", NA)
```

`r EndAnswer()`

### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
In your own words, describe the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments to `str_c()`.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The `sep` argument is the string inserted between arguments to `str_c`, while `collapse` is the string used to separate any elements of the character vector into a character vector of length one.

`r EndAnswer()`

### Exercise 3 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Use `str_length()` and `str_sub()` to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The following function extracts the middle character. If the string has an even number of characters the choice is arbitrary.
We choose to select $\lceil n / 2 \rceil$, because that case works even if the string is only of length one.
A more general method would allow the user to select either the floor or ceiling for the middle character of an even string.
```{r}
x <- c("a", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef")
L <- str_length(x)
m <- ceiling(L / 2)
str_sub(x, m, m)
```

`r EndAnswer()`

### Exercise 4 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
What does `str_wrap()` do? When might you want to use it?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The function `str_wrap` wraps text so that it fits within a certain width.
This is useful for wrapping long strings of text to be typeset.

`r EndAnswer()`

### Exercise 5 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
What does `str_trim()` do? What’s the opposite of `str_trim()`?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The function `str_trim` trims the whitespace from a string.
```{r}
str_trim(" abc ")
str_trim(" abc ", side = "left")
str_trim(" abc ", side = "right")
```

The opposite of `str_trim` is `str_pad` which adds characters to each side.

```{r}
str_pad("abc", 5, side = "both")
str_pad("abc", 4, side = "right")
str_pad("abc", 4, side = "left")
```

`r EndAnswer()`

### Exercise 6 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

See the Chapter [Functions] for more details on writing R functions.

```{r}
str_commasep <- function(x, sep = ", ", last = ", and ") {
  if (length(x) > 1) {
    str_c(str_c(x[-length(x)], collapse = sep),
                x[length(x)],
                sep = last)
  } else {
    x
  }
}
str_commasep("")
str_commasep("a")
str_commasep(c("a", "b"))
str_commasep(c("a", "b", "c"))
```

`r EndAnswer()`

## Matching Patterns and Regular Expressions

### Basic Matches

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Explain why each of these strings don’t match a `\`: `"\"`, `"\\"`, `"\\\"`.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

- `"\"`: This will escape the next character in the R string.
- `"\\"`: This will resolve to `\` in the regular expression, which will escape the next character in the regular expression.
- `"\\\"`: The first two backslashes will resolve to a literal backslash in the regular expression, the third will escape the next character. So in the regular expression, this will escape some escaped character.

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
How would you match the sequence `"'\` ?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view("\"'\\", "\"'\\\\")
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 3 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
What patterns will the regular expression `\..\..\..` match? How would you represent it as a string?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

It will match any patterns that are a dot followed by any character, repeated three times.

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(c(".a.b.c", ".a.b", "....."), c("\\..\\..\\.."))
```

```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
```
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "^a")
```

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "a$")
```

```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
```
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "apple")
```

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

`r EndAnswer()`

### Anchors

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
How would you match the literal string `"$^$"`?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(c("$^$", "ab$^$sfas"), "^\\$\\^\\$$")
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Given the corpus of common words in `stringr::words`, create regular expressions that find all words that:
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

>  1. Start with “y”.
>  2. End with “x”
>  3. Are exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using `str_length()`!)
>  4. Have seven letters or more.
>  
> Since this list is long, you might want to use the match argument to `str_view()` to show only the matching or non-matching words.


```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match =TRUE)
```

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "x$", match = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "^...$", match = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, ".......", match = TRUE)
```

`r EndAnswer()`

### Character classes and alternatives

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Create regular expressions to find all words that:
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`
>
> 1.  Start with a vowel.
> 2.  That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
> 3.  End with `ed`, but not with `eed`.
> 4.  End with `ing` or `ise`.

Words starting with vowels
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]", match = TRUE)
```

Words that contain only consonants
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "^[^aeiou]+$", match=TRUE)
```
This seems to require using the `+` pattern introduced later, unless one wants to be very verbose and specify words of certain lengths.

Words that end with `ed` but not with `eed`. This handles the special case of "ed", as well as words with length > 2.
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "^ed$|[^e]ed$", match = TRUE)
```

Words ending in `ing` or `ise`:
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "i(ng|se)$", match = TRUE)
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Empirically verify the rule ``i before e except after c''.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

Using only what has been introduced thus far:
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "(cei|[^c]ie)", match = TRUE)
```
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "(cie|[^c]ei)", match = TRUE)
```

Using `str_detect` we can count the number of words that follow these rules:
```{r eval=is_html}
sum(str_detect(stringr::words, "(cei|[^c]ie)"))
sum(str_detect(stringr::words, "(cie|[^c]ei)"))
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 3 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Is ``q'' always followed by a ``u''?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

In the `stringr::words` dataset, yes. In the full English language, no.
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(stringr::words, "q[^u]", match = TRUE)
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 4 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Write a regular expression that matches a word if it’s probably written in British English, not American English.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

In the general case, this is hard, and could require a dictionary.
But, there are a few heuristics to consider that would account for some common cases: British English tends to use the following:

- "ou" instead of "o"
- use of "ae" and "oe" instead of "a" and "o"
- ends in `ise` instead of `ize`
- ends in `yse`

The regex `ou|ise^|ae|oe|yse^` would match these.

There are other [spelling differences between American and British English] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences) but they are not patterns amenable to regular expressions.
It would require a dictionary with differences in spellings for different words.

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 5 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Create a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

The answer to this will vary by country.

For the United States, phone numbers have a format like `123-456-7890`.
```{r eval=is_html}
x <- c("123-456-7890", "1235-2351")
str_view(x, "\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d")
```
or
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]")
```

This regular expression can be simplified with the `{m,n}` regular expression modifier introduced in the next section,
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(x, "\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}")
```

Note that this pattern doesn't account for phone numbers that are invalid because of unassigned area code, or special numbers like 911, or extensions. See the Wikipedia page for the [North American Numbering Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan) for more information on the complexities of US phone numbers, and [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123559/a-comprehensive-regex-for-phone-number-validation) for a discussion of using a regex for phone number validation.

### Repetition

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Describe the equivalents of `?`, `+`, `*` in `{m,n}` form.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

----- ---------  ----------------------------------
`-`   `{,1}`     Match at most 1
`+`   `{1,}`     Match one or more
`*`   None       No equivalent
----- ---------  ----------------------------------

The `*` pattern has no `{m,n}` equivalent since there is no upper bound on the number of matches. The expected pattern `{,}` is not valid.
```{r error=TRUE,eval=is_html}
str_view("abcd", ".{,}")
```


`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Describe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if I’m using a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`
>
> 1.  `^.*$`
> 2.  `"\\{.+\\}"`
> 3.  `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`
> 4.  `"\\\\{4}"`


-------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`^.*$`               Any string
`"\\{.+\\}"`         Any string with curly braces surrounding at least one character.
`\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`  Four digits followed by a hyphen, followed by two digits followed by a hyphen, followed by another two digits. This is a regular expression that can match dates formatted like "YYYY-MM-DD" ("%Y-%m-%d").
 `"\\\\{4}"`         This resolves to the regular expression `\\{4}`, which is four backslashes.

Examples:

- `^.*$`: `c("dog", "$1.23", "lorem ipsum")`
- `"\\{.+\\}"`: `c("{a}", "{abc}")`
- `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`: `2018-01-11`
- `"\\\\{4}"`: `"\\\\\\\\"` (Backslashes in an R character vector need to be escaped.)

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 3 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Create regular expressions to find all words that:
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`
>
> 1. Start with three consonants.
> 2. Have three or more vowels in a row.
> 3. Have two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.

A regex to find all words starting with three consonants
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "^[^aeiou]{3}")
```

A regex to find three or more vowels in a row:
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "[aeiou]{3,}")
```

Two or more vowel-consonant pairs in a row.
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "([aeiou][^aeiou]){2,}")
```

### Grouping and backreferences

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`
>
> 1.  `(.)\1\1` :
> 2.  `"(.)(.)\\2\\1"`:
> 3.  `(..)\1`: Any two characters repeated. E.g. `"a1a1"`.
> 4.  `"(.).\\1.\\1"`:
> 5.  `"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"`


1.  `(.)\1\1` : The same character appearing three times in a row. E.g. `"aaa"`
2.  `"(.)(.)\\2\\1"`: A pair of characters followed by the same pair of characters in reversed order. E.g. `"abba"`.
3.  `(..)\1`: Any two characters repeated. E.g. `"a1a1"`.
4.  `"(.).\\1.\\1"`: A character followed by any character, the original character, any other character, the original character again. E.g. `"abaca"`, `"b8b.b"`.
5.  `"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"` Three characters followed by zero or more characters of any kind followed by the same three characters but in reverse order. E.g. `"abcsgasgddsadgsdgcba"` or `"abccba"` or `"abc1cba"`.

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Construct regular expressions to match words that:
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`
>
> 1. Start and end with the same character. Assuming the word is more than one character and all strings are considered words, `^(.).*\1$`
> 2. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. ``church'' contains ``ch'' repeated twice.)
> 3. Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. ``eleven'' contains three ``e''s.)


Start and end with the same character. Assuming the word is more than one character and all strings are considered words, `^(.).*\1$`:
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "^(.).*\\1$")
```

Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. “church” contains “ch” repeated twice.):

I'll consider several patterns with varying levels of generality.
This pattern checks for any pair of repeated characters:
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "(..).*\\1")
```
This pattern is checks for any pair of repeated "letters":
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view(words, "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]).*\\1")
```


Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. ``eleven'' contains three ``e''s.)

```{r}
str_subset(str_to_lower(words), "([a-z]).*\\1.*\\1")
```
The `\\1` is used to refer back to the first group (`(.)`) so that whatever letter is matched by `[A-Za-z]` is again matched.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple `str_detect()` calls.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

  1. Find all words that start or end with x.
  2. Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
  3. Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?

Words that start or end with `x`?
```{r}


# one regex
words[str_detect(words, "^x|x$")]
# split regex into parts
start_with_x <- str_detect(words, "^x")
end_with_x <- str_detect(words, "x$")
words[start_with_x | end_with_x]
```

Find all words starting with vowel and ending with consonant.

```{r}
str_subset(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$") %>% head()
start_with_vowel <- str_detect(words, "^[aeiou]")
end_with_consonant <- str_detect(words, "[^aeiou]$")
words[start_with_vowel & end_with_consonant] %>% head()
```

Words that contain at least one of each vowel.
I can't think of a good way of doing this without doing a regex of the permutations:
```{r}
pattern <-
  cross_n(rerun(5, c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")),
        .filter = function(...) {
          x <- as.character(unlist(list(...)))
          length(x) != length(unique(x))
        }) %>%
  map_chr(~ str_c(unlist(.x), collapse = ".*")) %>%
  str_c(collapse = "|")

str_subset(words, pattern)

words[str_detect(words, "a") &
        str_detect(words, "e") &
        str_detect(words, "i") &
        str_detect(words, "o") &
        str_detect(words, "u")]

```
There appear to be none.
To check that it works,
```{r}
str_subset("aseiouds", pattern)
```

### Extract Matches


#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a color. Modify the regex to fix the problem.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

This was the original color match pattern:
```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
```
It matches "flickered" because it matches "red".
The problem is that the previous pattern will match any word with the name of a color inside it. We want to only match colors in which the entire word is the name of the color.
We can do this by adding a `\b` (to indicate a word boundary) before and after the pattern:
```{r}
colour_match2 <- str_c("\\b(", str_c(colours, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")
colour_match2
```

```{r}
more2 <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
```
```{r eval=is_html}
str_view_all(more2, colour_match2, match = TRUE)
```

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
From the Harvard sentences data, extract:

1. The first word from each sentence.
2. All words ending in `ing`.
3. All plurals.
`r EndQuestion()`

`r BeginAnswer()`
The first word in each sentence requires defining what a word is. I'll consider a word any contiguous
```{r}
str_extract(sentences, "[a-zA-X]+") %>% head()
```

All words ending in `ing`:
```{r}
pattern <- "\\b[A-Za-z]+ing\\b"
sentences_with_ing <- str_detect(sentences, pattern)
unique(unlist(str_extract_all(sentences[sentences_with_ing], pattern))) %>%
  head()
```

All plurals. This cannot be done correctly with regular expressions alone.
It would require morphological inforation about words in the language.
See [WordNet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordnet/index.html) for a resource that would do that.
However, identifying words that end in an "s" and with more than three characters in order to remove "as", "is", "gas", etc., will provide a reasonable approximation.
```{r}
unique(unlist(str_extract_all(sentences, "\\b[A-Za-z]{3,}s\\b"))) %>%
  head()

### Splitting

#### Exercise 1 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Split up a string like `"apples, pears, and bananas"` into individual components.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

```{r}
x <- c("apples, pears, and bananas")
str_split(x, ", +(and +)?")[[1]]
```


`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 2 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
Why is it better to split up by `boundary("word")` than `" "`?
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

Splitting by `boundary("word")` is a more intelligent means of splitting up a string into words.
It will recognize non-space punctation that splits words, and also remove that punctuation from words.
You can read the set of rules that are used to determine word boundaries on the [ICU website](http://userguide.icu-project.org/boundaryanalysis).

Consider this sentence from the official [Unicode Report on word boundaries](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries),
```{r}
sentence <- "The quick (“brown”) fox can’t jump 32.3 feet, right?"
```
Splitting the string on spaces considers will group the punctuation with the words,
```{r}
str_split(sentence, " ")
```
However, splitting the string using `boundary("word")` correctly removes punctuation, while not
separating "32.2" and "can't",
```{r}
str_split(sentence, boundary("word"))
```

`r EndAnswer()`

#### Exercise 3 {.exercise}


`r BeginQuestion()`
What does splitting with an empty string `("")` do? Experiment, and then read the documentation.
`r EndQuestion()`


`r BeginAnswer()`

```{r}
